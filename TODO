TODO

- add a way to check if the value after operation is null. If it is, remove it from the pile
- add a way to adapt the width of the pile in its toString method (by checking the size of the object's representation when putting them in
- returns the error as String in PileRPL so that the output can printed to the user
- Detach CalcUI from the thread to allow a unique PileRPL to be shared by many users
- Add other operations (mult, div)
